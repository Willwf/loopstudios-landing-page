## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've used this project to reinforce some HTML, CSS and JS concepts, React training and, mostly, to use styled-components. This is my first time using it and I really think that it's very interesting. There are some things that I still need to understand, but is very useful to manage the components, especially when your project is getting too big.

### Continued development

For my next project I'm willing to do something using an external API, to fully understand and learn about it, as well something to start learn about back-end.
